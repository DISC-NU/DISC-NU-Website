### ← /app/lib

Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions. 

### ← /app/ui

Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.

Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.

### ← /scripts

Contains a seeding script that you'll use to populate your database in a later chapter.

### ← Config Files

You'll also notice config files such as next.config.js at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using create-next-app. You will not need to modify them in this course.
